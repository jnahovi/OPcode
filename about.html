				<h4> As one of the co-founders of OPcode, Jonah is one of two people responsible for the general operation of OPcode. Currently, Jonah is responsible for curriculum development, sceduling, and website mantinence. He currently attends Edison High School, and does much at his school to spread and encourage computer science knowledge. Currently, on Edison's robotics team, Mindcraft Robotics (yes, we do need to change the name to avoid a copyright lawsuit), Jonah serves as head programmer, responsible for the development of stable, efficient code for their robot and web app (which was built to collect data on a team's abilities, I swear it's less creepy than it sounds). Along with that, Jonah works for a non-profit organization, Valley Stem, where he remains responsible for the development of computer science related lessons and curriculum.  <br><br>From the sounds of it, this kid does a lot, but then again, he wrote this paragraph, so he may or may not have stretched quite a bit of this information. He also may or may not have created this website, so yes, it's quite egotistical that he put himself at the top of the page instead of the bottom of the page, kind of like that kid on a group assigment that does nothing on the project but puts his name first. Nonetheless, Jonah remains dedicated to this program, and is ready to help deliver high-quality programming tutorials to schools all over Fresno Unified (I had to write that entire thing about myself in the third person and now I'm having a hard time going back to first person please help)</br></br> </h4>
